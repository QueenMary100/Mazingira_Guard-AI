# 🌿 MazingiraGuard AI: Autonomous Environmental Intelligence

**MazingiraGuard AI** is a next-generation, autonomous surveillance and conservation platform designed to protect Kenya's "Water Towers" and critical biodiversity hotspots. By combining multimodal satellite/drone imagery analysis with persistent marathon reasoning, it empowers wildlife rangers to combat illegal logging, poaching, and environmental degradation in real-time.

## 🚀 Core Mission
Kenya's natural heritage is under constant threat from silent, incremental environmental crimes. MazingiraGuard AI serves as a persistent, 24/7 autonomous guard, bridging the gap between high-altitude telemetry and actionable ground-truth intelligence.

## 🧠 Technical Mental Model: "Marathon Agent"
Unlike traditional AI models that treat every query as an isolated event, MazingiraGuard AI utilizes a **Marathon Agent** architecture:
- **Thought Signatures:** Maintains persistent memory of regional telemetry to track temporal changes (e.g., the slow expansion of an illegal charcoal kiln).
- **Temporal Variance:** Uses persistent reasoning to distinguish between natural seasonal shifts and anthropogenic encroachment.
- **Grounded Cognition:** Every detection is cross-verified via **Google Search Grounding** to ensure alerts are contextualized with local laws, environmental news, and protected status.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🛰️ Satellite Monitoring:** Ingests multispectral imagery for real-time sector analysis and change detection.
- **📂 Incident Registry:** A robust terminal for rangers to manage, verify, and export environmental crime reports.
- **🗺️ Interactive GIS:** Embedded satellite mapping to visualize precise detection coordinates.
- **🎙️ Accessible HQ Terminal:** A multimodal chatbot for field use featuring:
  - **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Hands-free query input for rangers in the field.
  - **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Professional audio explanations via Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS.
  - **Video Simulations:** Cinematic 4K visualizations of reports using the **Veo** model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Modern Dark Mode / Emerald Forest Theme)
- **AI Core:**
  - `gemini-3-pro-preview`: For complex reasoning and multimodal vision.
  - `gemini-3-flash-preview`: For high-speed conversational liaison.
  - `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`: For high-fidelity accessible audio output.
  - `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`: For cinematic environmental visualizations.
- **Grounding:** Google Search & Google Maps Integration.

## 🛡️ Security & Ethics
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Secured terminal access for verified KWS personnel.
- **Ground-Truth Verification:** Built-in feedback loops where human rangers refine the agent's "Thought Signatures."
